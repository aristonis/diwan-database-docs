# Agent rules file

Your project's coding agent reads one rules file at the start of a session: `AGENTS.md` for most agents, `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code. Add the block below to it. It is a copy of `ai/AGENTS.md` from the code repository, so take the newest copy from there when you upgrade Diwan.

## Include it

Paste the block into the file, under its own heading. Or keep a copy of `ai/AGENTS.md` in your repository and reference it from your file. Claude Code reads another file when your `CLAUDE.md` contains an `@ai/AGENTS.md` line.

# Diwan Database rules

Diwan Database (`org.aristonis:diwan-database`) is a Java port of Laravel's database layer:
connections and transactions, query builder, schema builder, migrations, and Eloquent-style models.
It runs on Java 17 or later and on Android 9 (API 28) or later. Databases: SQLite and PostgreSQL.
Method names follow Laravel (`where`, `orderBy`, `firstOrCreate`). Java idioms replace PHP ones:
`Optional`, `java.time`, try-with-resources, unchecked exceptions.

## Entry points

Start from a `DatabaseManager`. It builds the query factory, schema and migrator from the
connection's configuration, so your code never names a driver class and switching the database is a
configuration change.

```java
QueryFactory db = manager.query();                 // default connection; manager.query("name") for another
Schema schema = manager.schema();
Migrator migrator = manager.migrator("main").add(new CreateUsersTable()).build();
db.table("users").where("id", 1).first();
```

Models: `User.query.on(manager.query())`.

Without a manager, take the factories from the grammar module: `SQLiteQuery.of(connection)`,
`SQLiteSchema.of(connection)`, `PostgresQuery.of(connection)`, `PostgresSchema.of(connection)`. On
Android, `AndroidConnector.of(() -> helper, SQLiteQuery::of, SQLiteSchema::of)` is registered once
with the manager. Inside a transaction, call `db.on(tx)` so the work runs on the transaction.

## Rules

Always:

- Close a `QueryCursor` with try-with-resources. A `stream()` from it releases the connection only
  when the stream is closed.
- Check any sort column that comes from a user against a fixed allowlist before `orderBy`.
  Identifiers are quoted, not bound.
- Run row locks (`lockForUpdate`, `sharedLock`, `lock`) only inside a transaction, on the
  connection the callback gives you. PostgreSQL throws outside one.
- Pass values as bindings. Use `whereRaw(sql, bindings)` and `selectRaw(sql, bindings)`.
- Declare `checksum()` on every migration, and name each migration with a fixed string in `name()`.
- Declare each model as `public static final ModelQuery<T> query = ModelQuery.of(T.class, T::new)`.
- On Android, override `table()` on models and name relation keys explicitly, or keep model class
  names in R8.
- Use the `tx` connection inside `db.transaction(tx -> ...)`.
- Keep an Android transaction, and a cursor, on the thread that opened it.

Never:

- Build SQL by joining strings with user input, in `whereRaw`, `orderByRaw`, `fromRaw` or anywhere.
- Edit a migration that already ran. Add a new migration. Use `repairChecksums` only on purpose,
  after an edit you meant to make.
- Call `upsert` on SQLite older than 3.24 (Android API 28 and 29). It throws
  `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- Use reflection or annotations to register models, relations or migrations. Diwan scans nothing.
- Call the root connection from inside
  one of its own transactions. Strict transactions refuse it with `IllegalStateException`.
- Put a connection string with a password, or binding values with personal data, in logs or issues.

## Keep it short

The block is the rules only. Task steps live in the [skills](skills.md), which load when needed. Do not paste the guides into the rules file.

Each rule has a reason and a guide page on [Rules](rules.md).
